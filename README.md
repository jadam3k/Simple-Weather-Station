# Simple Weather Station

This is a simple weather station project programmed on an **ESP32**.

## Description
The project connects to the internet and displays weather data fetched from a free online API.  
It also uses a local **DHT sensor** for temperature and humidity readings.  
The whole setup is built on a **breadboard**, as soldering or making a PCB would be overkill for this project.

## Components Used
I am not adding a `BOM.csv` file because it’s not necessary (I’m not applying for a grant).  
If a list of parts is required, the project uses:

- ESP32  
- 3 LEDs  
- 0.91" OLED display  
- Button module  
- DHT sensor  
- Jumper wires  



## Demo
Below, I’m sharing a video that shows how the project looks and works.
